This page is a landing page for the ISWC 2024 Demo submission _Towards Easier Authoring of Vocabularies and Application Profiles using Dataspecer_.

Dataspecer [source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/mff-uk/dataspecer), the demo instance is running from the [`iswc2024` branch](https://github.com/mff-uk/dataspecer/tree/iswc2024).

In our demo instance, you can try building your own vocabulary and application profile, or you can follow our Demo scenario described below.

Alternatively, you can watch a video of us going through the scenario.

## Demo scenario

### Part I - Vocabulary creation and publication

Suppose I am in the role of the [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/) specification editor, and I want to start specifying DCAT from scratch.
1. I create a new specification DCAT.
   1. Go to "new manager" `https://tool.dataspecer.com/manager/`
   2. "Start a new project", "Vocabulary"
   3. Name: "DCAT", Description "DCAT in Dataspecer", Base IRI `http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#`, Base URL documentation `https://mff-uk.github.io/demo-specifications/test1/`
2. I create new classes with IRIs, labels, definitions in English and Czech. Click on "Add class" (after https://github.com/mff-uk/dataspecer/issues/573)
   1. `dcat:Resource` - https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Resource
   2. `dcat:Catalog` - https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Catalog
   3. `dcat:Dataset` - https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Dataset
   4. `dcat:Distribution` - https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Distribution
   5. `dcat:Role` - https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Role
3. I specify that `dcat:Catalog` is subclass of `dcat:Dataset` and `dcat:Dataset` is subClassOf `dcat:Resource`. (https://github.com/mff-uk/dataspecer/issues/547)
4. I specify that `dcat:Role` subclassof `skos:Concept` - here I need SKOS first
    1. Because SKOS does not have a machine readable representation linked from the spec, I need to find it first. But it does not support CORS. So we use `https://datagov-cz.github.io/cache-slovniku/skos.rdf` and we will se later in profiling how it is easier with our approach
    2. Then I can do the subclassof
5. I create new attributes with IRIs, labels, definitions in English and Czech, ranges:
    1. Dataset: `dcat:temporalResolution`, range: `xsd:duration`, Temporal resolution
    2. Distribution: `dcat:accessURL`, range: `rdfs:Resource` _see https://github.com/mff-uk/dataspecer/issues/545_, rdfs from `https://datagov-cz.github.io/cache-slovniku/rdfs.ttl` is needed, and this has to be modeled as a relation now. Consider moving to relations.
6. I create new relationships with IRIs, labels, definitions in English and Czech, ranges and domains:
    1. `dcat:Catalog` -- `dcat:dataset` --> `dcat:Dataset` - https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:catalog_dataset
    2. `dcat:Dataset` -- `dcat:distribution` --> `dcat:Distribution` - https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:dataset_distribution
7. Now I add a relationship with range specified by existing vocabulary
    1. I add `dcat:Catalog` -- `dcat:themeTaxonomy` --> `skos:ConceptScheme`
    2. I add `dcat:Resource` -- `dcat:theme` --> `skos:Concept`
        1. `dcat:theme` `rdfs:subPropertyOf` `dcterms:subject` - _I need dcterms first_ - again, from `https://datagov-cz.github.io/cache-slovniku/dublin_core_terms.ttl` due to missing CORS

TODO: Add Respec metadata to the spec

### Part II - Profiling

Now I want to create the DCAT "Default application profile" - set cardinalities, usage notes, include classes and properties from other vocabularies directly.

Notation: `DCAT::dcat:Catalog` means `dcat:Catalog` class profile in application profile called `DCAT`. will not suffice for multiple profiles of the same thing in the same profile, but we can deal with that later.

1. I will "create a profile of" the previously published DCAT as simple as possible - via providing the URL of the spec document. Thanks to machine readable links and machine readable representation of the profile, I expect to land in CME with the DCAT, DCTERMS and SKOS models loaded, possibly even with a view created previously in scope of DCAT. _here we need to think about external representation of the view - not currently covered by DSV - could it be "just a JSON" artifact? I suppose so..._
    1. **TODO: We are missing the DSV -> DS import functionality**
    2. This is where we are better than the SKOS and DCTERMS reuse before _TODO Kuba: Check that there are no machine readable links in SKOS and DCTERMS pages_
    3. Also consider already automatically creating profiles of everything found in DCAT (Petr). If not, create profiles of everything found in DCAT manually.
2. Add class profiles
   1. Add `DCAT::dcat:Resource` class profile to serve as domain
   2. Add `DCAT::dcat:Distribution` class profile to serve as domain
   3. Add `DCAT::dcat:Dataset` class profile
   4. Add `DCAT::dcat:Catalog` class profile
   5. Add class profile `DCAT::foaf:Agent` from FOAF (`https://datagov-cz.github.io/cache-slovniku/foaf.ttl`)
3. Add attribute profiles
    1. `DCAT::dcterms:title` - domain `DCAT::dcat:Resource` (was `owl:Thing`), cardinality `1..*`, range `rdfs:Literal`, name `title` was `Title` - (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:resource_title)
    2. `DCAT::dcterms:description` - domain `DCAT::dcat:Resource` (was `owl:Thing`), cardinality `0..*`, range `rdfs:Literal` (was undefined), name `description` was `Description` - (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:resource_description)
    3. `DCAT::dcat:Distribution`: `DCAT::dcterms:title` - here, the domain is Distribution - domain: `DCAT::dcat:Distribution`, name `title` was `Title`, description `A name given to the distribution.`, range `rdf:langString`
    4. `DCAT::dcat:Distribution`: `DCAT::dcterms:description`  - domain `DCAT::dcat:Distribution`, name `description` was `Description`, range `rdf:langString`

4. Add relationship profiles
    1. `DCAT::dcat:Catalog`: `DCAT::dcterms:publisher` -> `DCAT::foaf:Agent` - name `An entity responsible for making the catalog available.` was `An entity responsible for making the resource available.`, domain `DCAT::dcat:Catalog`, range `DCAT::foaf:Agent`, cardinality `1..1`
    2. `DCAT::dcat:Dataset`: `DCAT::dcat:distribution` -> `DCAT::dcat:Distribution` - domain and range changed to profiles, cardinality `0..*`

Now I have my application profile. I want to publish the result again.
There will be a respec, and it will link to the reused classes/properties in the previously published DCAT and other vocabularies

Respec will be accompanied by a machine readable (DSV) representation of the profile.

### Part III - Open a profile for further profiling
In DS, I need to be able to import the published profile - it needs to import the reused vocabularies and the application profile itself based on DSV, including views.
Here, we can end - it is clear that we can iterate the process.
