manager
=======

Manager or Schema manager is a web app where you can create new data specifications and data schemas and generate artifacts. The manager then redirects the user to the [editor](../editor) to edit the schema. Currently, the manager is a simple application, but there are plans to extend it. The manager should configure generators and data schema, manage user permissions, support SOLID, etc.

The manager communicates with the [backend](../../services/backend) service.
