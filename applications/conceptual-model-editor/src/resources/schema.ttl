    rdfs:comment "The amount of fuel consumed for traveling a particular distance or temporal duration with the given vehicle (e.g. liters per 100 km).\\n\\n* Note 1: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for liters per 100 km.  Use [[unitText]] to indicate the unit of measurement, e.g. L/100 km.\\n* Note 2: There are two ways of indicating the fuel consumption, [[fuelConsumption]] (e.g. 8 liters per 100 km) and [[fuelEfficiency]] (e.g. 30 miles per gallon). They are reciprocal.\\n* Note 3: Often, the absolute value is useful only when related to driving speed (\"at 80 km/h\") or usage pattern (\"city traffic\"). You can use [[valueReference]] to link the value for the fuel consumption to another value." .
