# data psm

This directory contains components that render the schema tree. Because some data psm entities may be too wordy, some components render multiple entities as one thing. For example, `DataPsmAssociationEnd` component renders the data psm association end and the class or entity in general which belongs to the association.

The main component is `DataPsmSchemaItem`, which renders the whole schema and, therefore, all its parts.
