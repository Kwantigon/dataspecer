# Wikidata entity detail

Contains detail dialog component used in surroundings and search dialog.
To use the components, it is necessary to create the `WikidataAdapterContext`, so the components could use the backend API calls.

The dialog is "click-through" meaning clicking on entities will move to the entity detail.
The user can then use a back button to return to the previous entity.
